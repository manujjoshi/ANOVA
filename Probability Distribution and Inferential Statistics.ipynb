    "- Bernoulli Distribution is a type of discrete probability distribution where every experiment conducted asks a question that can be answered only in yes or no. In other words, the random variable can be 1 with a probability p or it can be 0 with a probability (1 - p). Such an experiment is called a Bernoulli trial. A pass or fail exam can be modeled by a Bernoulli Distribution.\n",
    "- If we have a Binomial Distribution where n = 1 then it becomes a Bernoulli Distribution. As this distribution is very easy to understand, it is used as a basis for deriving more complex distributions. Bernoulli Distribution can be used to describe events that can only have two outcomes, that is, success or failure.\n",

    "- Permutation and combination form the principles of counting and they are applied in various situations. A permutation is a count of the different arrangements which can be made from the given set of things. In permutation the details matter, as the order or sequence is important. Writing the names of three countries {USA, Brazil, Australia} or {Australia, USA, Brazil) or { Brazil, Australia, USA} is different and this sequence in which the names of the countries are written is important. In combinations, the name of three countries is just a single group, and the sequence or order does not matter.\n",

    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "1. The formula for Poisson distribution is f(x) = P(X=x) = (e-λ λx )/x!.\n",

    "3. For Poisson distribution, the mean and the variance of the distribution are equal.\n",
